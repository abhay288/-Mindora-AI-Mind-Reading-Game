# Mindora Assets Guide

This game is designed to use external assets for the best experience. Since these files are binary (audio/animation), they cannot be generated by the AI agent.

## 1. Character Animation
**Location**: `public/animations/mindora_avatar.riv`
-   **Description**: The Rive file for the main character.
-   **If missing**: The game will display a glowing "Fallback Orb".
-   **How to get**: Export a `.riv` file from Rive.app or use a sample one.

## 2. Sound Effects
**Location**: `public/sounds/`
Please place the following MP3 files in their respective folders:

### `public/sounds/ambient/`
-   `intro.mp3`: Plays when the game loads (Intro screen).

### `public/sounds/ui/`
-   `click.mp3`: Plays when hovering over buttons.
-   `select.mp3`: Plays when clicking an answer.

### `public/sounds/game/`
-   `win.mp3`: Plays when the AI guesses correctly.
-   `lose.mp3`: Plays when the AI gives up.

> **Note**: The game will work perfectly fine without these files (it will just be silent).
