# 🧠 Mindora — AI Mind-Reading Game

> **Mindora** is an intelligent, self-learning mind-reading game inspired by Akinator — but built with a modern, adaptive AI architecture.  
It asks smart questions, learns from mistakes, avoids repetition, and improves continuously over time.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Intelligent Guessing Engine
- Rule-based reasoning + Bayesian probability
- Fuzzy logic scoring
- Entropy-based question selection
- Confidence fusion system (Rule + ML + Fuzzy + Pattern)

### 🧠 Adaptive Learning
- Learns when it guesses wrong (Teach Mode)
- Session learning boost
- Pattern recognition across games
- Popularity drift for trending entities
- Self-healing when accuracy drops

### 🔁 Smart Questioning
- Prevents repeated or similar questions
- Semantic similarity detection
- Question fatigue prevention
- Dynamic phrasing (human-like variation)

### 🎭 Human-Like Experience
- Thinking pauses based on difficulty
- Emotional avatar reactions
- Confidence smoothing for natural progression
- Premium, minimal UI

### 📊 Silent Intelligence (Backend Telemetry)
- Analytics logging (turns, confidence, latency)
- Performance monitoring
- A/B weight testing (engine optimization)
- Entity health tracking
> Telemetry runs silently — **not shown to users**

### 📱 Product-Ready
- Fully mobile-responsive
- SEO-optimized (meta tags, schema, sitemap)
- Fast and lightweight
- Shareable results (WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Copy Link)

## 🧪 Game Flow

1. User thinks of a character
2. Mindora asks adaptive questions
3. Confidence increases smoothly
4. Mindora guesses
5. If wrong → user teaches correct answer
6. Mindora learns and improves

---

## 🎓 Teach Mode (Simple & Friendly)

- One-step correction
- User provides correct answer
- Thank-you animation
- Play again

No complex forms.  
No friction.

---

## 🛡️ Stability & Safety

- No raw errors exposed to users
- Intelligent fallback logic
- Secure environment variables
- Input sanitization
- Graceful API failure handling

---

## 📦 Deployment

Mindora is **production-ready** and deployed on **Netlify**.

### Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Project Status

**🧠 Mindora is in Learning Phase**

The system continuously improves as more people play.

## 🙌 Credits

Built with passion, curiosity, and a lot of thinking time.  
Inspired by the idea of human-like reasoning, not brute-force AI.

## 💡 Vision

Mindora is not just a game.

It is an experiment in:

- Cognitive UX
- Adaptive intelligence
- Perceived reasoning
- Human-AI interaction
